## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned
I had most difficulty trying to hover the image with another image with different trials and fixes i got to understand the different patterns to Hovering image on another image and which way works for different procedures.
a snippet of a code
```css

.showhim:hover .showme {
display: block;
height: 300px;
width: auto;
background-repeat: inherit;
cursor: pointer;

}

So far I've implemented all details of layouts and positioning from CSS I learnt 
```
